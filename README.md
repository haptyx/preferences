# Haptyx's Preference Files
This is the place where I will store my preference files and update them. It currently contains:

- .bashrc (Bash)
- .vimrc (Vim)
- user.js (Firefox)

## .bashrc
Some helpers and usefulness. Nicer prompt.
## .vimrc
As SublimeText like as possible while still being vim.
## user.js
Lots of hardening and general performance tweaks. Still remains usable.
